# About:
This is a place where I store my custom CTF scripts. The most valuable one being the `hacktheboxer.sh`, which is really a streamliner of my wokflow with tmux and fzf. These are the tools I use for the boot2root CTFs.
## Included scripts:
- `hacktheboxer.sh`


# Usage:
Copying the scripts to your local PATH is just enough if you are working with a non-root account.
```
# adds every script to PATH
cp ./scripts/ ${HOME}/.local/bin/
```
