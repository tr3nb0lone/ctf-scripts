# About:
This is a place where I store my custom CTF scripts. The most valuable one being the `hacktheboxer.sh`, which is really a strreamliner of my wokflow with tmux. These are the tools I use for the boot2root CTFs.
## Included scripts:
- `hacktheboxer.sh`
- ``

# Usage:
Copying the scripts to your local PATH is just enough if you are working with a non-root account.
```
cp 

```
